                    "Fire extinguishers apply an agent that will cool burning heat, smother fuel or remove oxygen so the fire cannot continue to burn. A portable fire extinguisher can quickly control a small fire if applied by an individual properly trained.",
            "What is fire hose explained?\n\n" + "fire hoses are made of a nitrile rubber tube that is insulated by a woven polyester fabric jacket instead of the cotton fire hose canvas used in the past. However, Fire hose can be classified in different ways based on such criteria as fire hose material, thickness and method of construction.\n" +
                    "The three basic types of fire hose are single jacket, double jacket and rubber-covered lay-flat, but these are sometimes combined to create hoses for specific functions.",
            "What is smoke detector explained?\n\n" +
                    "A smoke detector is an electronic fire-protection device that automatically senses the presence of smoke, as a key indication of fire, and sounds a warning to building occupants.\n" +
                    "Commercial and industrial smoke detectors issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a buildingâ€™s central fire alarm system. By law all workplaces must have a smoke detection system.",
            "What is fire sprinkler explained?\n\n"+"A fire sprinkler or sprinkler head is the component of a fire sprinkler system that discharges water when the effects of a fire have been detected, such as when a predetermined temperature has been exceeded. Fire sprinklers are extensively used worldwide, with over 40 million sprinkler heads fitted each year. In buildings protected by properly designed and maintained fire sprinklers, over 99% of fires were controlled by fire sprinklers alone",
            "Why do we throw sand over a fire?\n" +
                    "Oil fires are resistant to water, but small fires can be effectively extinguished when the sand in the bucket is dumped on the fire to starve it of the oxygen it needs to stay alight. This method of fighting liquid fires has generally been replaced by modern foaming agents.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "What is filled in fire bucket?\n" +
                    "Fire buckets filled with clean dry sand and ready for immediate use for extinguishing fires, in addition to fire extinguishers suitable for dealing with electric fires, shall be conspicuously marked and kept in all generating stations, enclosed sub-stations and switch stations in convenient situation.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Does sand work on fire?\n" +
                    "Because its primary constituent is silica (SiO2), which is already oxidized, sand cannot burn. This is why it works as an effective firefighting method, which can extinguish fires by cutting off the oxygen supply and absorbing flammable liquids."
